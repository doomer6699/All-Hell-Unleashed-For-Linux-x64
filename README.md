# All Hell Unleashed - Linux Launcher Script

This is a simple GPLv3-licensed Bash script to launch the Mesen NES emulator with the ROM file for *All Hell Unleashed*, if available.

The game is not available in the directory, but you can download it from their website!

You can download the ROM from: https://8bitslasher.itch.io/ahu  

I make it clear that only the "play.sh" program has the GPLv3 license, the AHU game 
ROM will have the license that the creator of the same wishes to give it.
