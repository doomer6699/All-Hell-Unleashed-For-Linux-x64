-=Weapons & Combat=-
• Knife – Deals 1 damage to regular enemies. Short range but can be thrown rapidly.
• Brass Knuckle Knife – Deals 2 damage to regular enemies and can pass through blocks. Slower but travels a long distance.
• Molotov Cocktail – Deals 3 damage to regular enemies and can destroy breakable blocks. Follows an arc when thrown.
• Different weapons have unique effects on enemies and obstacles.
• Breakable Blocks will reappear if you leave the screen and return.

-=Behind the Horror=-
This is my swan song to my free NES horror fan games. This game began in January 2024 when I couldn’t decide which horror franchise to tackle next.. so I crammed in as many as possible! What began as a chaotic idea turned into a fully fleshed-out game, built to the best of my amateur abilities.

This has been the hardest game I’ve ever programmed. I can’t thank Kevin81 and Dale Coop enough for their coding expertise (and for putting up with me bugging them daily). It’s also the longest I’ve ever worked on a game. My other projects were short, simple games knocked out in 1-3 months tops. With this one, I’d go on quick creative bursts, then hit weeks of burnout, mentally recovering before diving back in.

But we stuck with it, and now we’re here. I’m proud of this farewell game, and I hope you all enjoy it as much as I enjoyed stitching this monster to life.

Started in January 2024. Released April 11, 2025.
