Go to the All Hell Unleashed creator's website and download the ROM! https://8bitslasher.itch.io/ahu 
 
Paste it into the folder along with the Mesen emulator.

Run the play.sh file from your terminal with the command "bash play.sh" or "./play.sh"

The executable will modify the .nes file name if it's incorrect.

After completing this process, it will run Mesen with the ROM. AHU!

Have fun!
